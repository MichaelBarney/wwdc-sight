//: ## 🐶 Dogs
//:
//: **Dogs don't see in black-and-white.** Let's bust that myth once and for all.
//: Dogs are deuteranopists. This means they only see the world in shades of
//: blues, greens and yellows. In addition, their vision is slightly more
//: blurry than human.

//: ## 🐈 Cats
//:
//: Cats have a very similar color perception as dogs, except slightly less blurry. However, cats have way more rodes in their eyes, allowing them to see in the dark. Tap that **moon** icon to compare how humans and cats see in the dark!
